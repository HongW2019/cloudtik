## Workspace

CloudTik uses **Workspace** concept to manage your Cloud network and other resources. 
Within one workspace, you can start one or multiple clusters.

## Cluster

Cloudtik helps users quickly create and manage analytics and AI clusters, 
which enables adding or removing compute, storage, and network services easily to meet the demands on prem and cloud providers.

## Provider

CloudTik supports node providers of your analytics and AI clusters both on prem and cloud such as AWS, Azure and GCP.

## Runtime

CloudTik introduces **Runtime** concept to integrate different analytics and AI framework to deploy into clusters.

- **Spark**,  a multi-language engine for executing data engineering, data science, and machine learning.

- **HDFS**, a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware.

- **Ganglia**, a scalable distributed monitoring system for high-performance computing systems such as clusters and Grids.

- **Metastore**, a service that stores metadata related to Apache Hive and other services.

- **Presto**, a distributed SQL query engine for running interactive analytic queries against data sources of all sizes.

- **ZooKeeper**, a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services.

- **Kafka**, a community distributed event streaming platform capable of handling trillions of events a day.
