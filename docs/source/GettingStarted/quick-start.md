# Quick Start

### 1. Preparing Python environment

CloudTik requires a Python environment on Linux, we recommend using Conda to manage Python environments and packages.

If you don't have Conda installed, please refer to `dev/install-conda.sh` to install Conda on Linux.

```
git clone https://github.com/oap-project/cloudtik.git && cd cloudtik
bash dev/install-conda.sh
```

Once Conda is installed, create an environment with a specific Python version as below.
CloudTik currently supports Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9. Here we take Python 3.7 as an example.

```
conda create -n cloudtik -y python=3.7
conda activate cloudtik
```

### 2. Installing CloudTik

Execute the following `pip` commands to install CloudTik on your working machine for specific cloud providers. 

Here we take AWS as an example.

```
# if running CloudTik on aws
pip install -U "cloudtik[aws] @ https://d30257nes7d4fq.cloudfront.net/downloads/cloudtik/cloudtik-0.9.0-cp37-cp37m-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl"
```

Replace `cloudtik[aws]` with `clouditk[azure]` or `cloudtik[gcp]` if you want to create clusters on Azure or GCP.
Use `cloudtik[all]` if you want to manage clusters with all supported Cloud providers.

You can install the latest CloudTik wheels via the following links. These daily releases do not go through the full release process.

| Linux      | Installation                                                                                                                                       |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Python 3.9 | `pip install -U "cloudtik[aws] @ https://d30257nes7d4fq.cloudfront.net/downloads/cloudtik/cloudtik-0.9.0-cp39-cp39-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl" `     |
| Python 3.8 | `pip install -U "cloudtik[aws] @ https://d30257nes7d4fq.cloudfront.net/downloads/cloudtik/cloudtik-0.9.0-cp38-cp38-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl" `     |
| Python 3.7 | `pip install -U "cloudtik[aws] @ https://d30257nes7d4fq.cloudfront.net/downloads/cloudtik/cloudtik-0.9.0-cp37-cp37m-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl" `    |


### 3. Authentication to Cloud Providers API

After CloudTik is installed on your working machine, then you need to configure or log into your Cloud account to 
gain access to cloud provider API on this machine.

#### AWS

Follow these steps from the command line to install the AWS CLI on your working Linux machine.

```
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
aws configure
```
After you enter this command `aws configure`, the AWS CLI prompts you for four pieces of information: *AWS Access Key ID*,
*AWS Secret Access Key*,  *Default region name* and *Default output format* to the command prompt.
Fill them out then AWS CLI will be installed and authenticated.

[AWS CLI Installation Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) 
and [CLI Configure Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html) provide more details. 

#### Azure

Login to Azure on your working machine using `az login`, then set the subscription to use from the command 
line (`az account set -s <subscription_id>`). Then the Azure CLI is configured to manage resources on your Azure account.

#### GCP

First, follow the [Google Cloud docs](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started#creating_a_service_account) 
to create a service account on Google Cloud, A JSON file should be safely downloaded and kept by you after the
service account created.

Then set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable as described in
[GCP docs](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started#setting_the_environment_variable) on your working machine.



### 4. Creating a Workspace for Clusters.

CloudTik uses **Workspace** concept to easily manage shared Cloud resources such as VPC, network, identity resources, 
firewall or security groups. In a Workspace, you can start one or more clusters.

Use the following command to create and provision a Workspace:

```
cloudtik workspace create your-workspace-config.yaml
```

A typical workspace configuration file is usually very simple. Specify the unique workspace name, cloud provider type
and a few cloud provider specific properties. 

Take AWS as example.

```
# A unique identifier for the workspace.
workspace_name: example-workspace

# Cloud-provider specific configuration.
provider:
    type: aws
    region: us-west-2
    security_group:
        # Use IpPermissions to allow SSH access from your working node
        # Remember to restrict IpRanges for security 
        IpPermissions:
        - FromPort: 22
          ToPort: 22
          IpProtocol: TCP
          IpRanges:
          - CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0
```
Check `example/cluster` folder for more Workspace configuration file examples.

### 5. Configuring Cloud Storage

If you choose cloud storage as file system or to store stage and event data, cloud storage account is needed.

After follow the guides below for specific cloud provider, you will be able to fill out the corresponding storage filed 
of your cluster configuration yaml. 

#### AWS

Every object in Amazon S3 is stored in a bucket. Before you can store data in Amazon S3, you must create a bucket.
Please refer to S3 [guides](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-bucket.html) for instructions.

Then fill out the `aws_s3_storage` field.

```
# Cloud-provider specific configuration.
provider:
    type: aws
    region: us-west-2
    # S3 configurations for storage
    aws_s3_storage:
        s3.bucket: your_s3_bucket
        s3.access.key.id: your_s3_access_key_id
        s3.secret.access.key: your_s3_secret_access_key

```

#### Azure

Create an Azure Storage Account if you don't have one.

Azure **Blob storage** or **Data Lake Storage Gen2** are both supported by CloudTik. Please refer to Azure related 
[guides](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal) for details.

Then fill out the `azure_cloud_storage` field.

```
# Cloud-provider specific configuration.
provider:
    type: azure
    location: westus
    subscription_id: your_subscription_id
    azure_cloud_storage:
        # Choose cloud storage type: blob (Azure Blob Storage) or datalake (Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2).
        azure.storage.type: datalake
        azure.storage.account: your_storage_account
        azure.container: your_container
        azure.account.key: your_account_key

```

#### GCP

If you do not already have a GCS bucket, create one and configure its permission for your service account.
Please refer to [gcs bucket guide](gcs-bucket.md) for more details.

Then fill out the `gcp_cloud_storage` field.

```
# Cloud-provider specific configuration.
provider:
    type: gcp
    region: us-central1
    availability_zone: us-central1-a
    project_id: your_project_id
    # GCS configurations for storage
    gcp_cloud_storage:
        gcs.bucket: your_gcs_bucket
        gcs.service.account.client.email: your_service_account_client_email
        gcs.service.account.private.key.id: your_service_account_private_key_id
        gcs.service.account.private.key: your_service_account_private_key

```

### 6. Starting a cluster

Now you can start a cluster:

```
cloudtik start your-cluster-config.yaml
```

A typical cluster configuration file is usually very simple thanks to CloudTik hierarchy templates design.

Take AWS as an example, this example can be found from CloudTik's `example/cluster/aws/example-standard.yaml`,
inheriting AWS standard template which locates in `python/cloudtik/templates/aws/standard.yaml`

```
# An example of standard 1 + 3 nodes cluster with standard instance type
# Inherits AWS standard template which locates in CloudTik's "python/cloudtik/templates/aws/standard.yaml"
from: aws/standard

# Workspace into which to launch the cluster
workspace_name: example-workspace

# A unique identifier for the cluster.
cluster_name: example-docker

# Enable container
docker:
    enabled: True

# Cloud-provider specific configuration.
provider:
    type: aws
    region: us-west-2
    # S3 configurations for storage
    aws_s3_storage:
        s3.bucket: your_s3_bucket
        s3.access.key.id: your_s3_access_key_id
        s3.secret.access.key: your_s3_secret_access_key

auth:
    ssh_user: ubuntu
    # Set proxy if you are in corporation network. For example,
    # ssh_proxy_command: "ncat --proxy-type socks5 --proxy your_proxy_host:your_proxy_port %h %p"

available_node_types:
    worker.default:
        # The minimum number of worker nodes to launch.
        min_workers: 3
```

You need the cloud storage access information in Step 5 and only a few additional key settings in the configuration file to launch a cluster.

Refer to `example/cluster` for more cluster configurations examples.

### 7. Managing clusters

CloudTik provides very powerful capability to monitor and manage the cluster.

#### Cluster status and information

Use the following commands to show various cluster information.

```
# Check cluster status with:
cloudtik status /path/to/your-cluster-config.yaml
# Show cluster summary information and useful links to connect to cluster web UI.
cloudtik info /path/to/your-cluster-config.yaml
cloudtik head-ip /path/to/your-cluster-config.yaml
cloudtik worker-ips /path/to/your-cluster-config.yaml
cloudtik process-status /path/to/your-cluster-config.yaml
cloudtik monitor /path/to/your-cluster-config.yaml
cloudtik debug-status /path/to/your-cluster-config.yaml
cloudtik health-check  /path/to/your-cluster-config.yaml
```
#### Attach to the cluster head (or specific node)

Connect to a terminal of cluster head node.

```
cloudtik attach /path/to/your-cluster-config.yaml
```

#### Execute and Submit Jobs

Execute a command via SSH on a cluster or a specified node.

```
cloudtik exec /path/to/your-cluster-config.yaml
```

#### Manage Files

Upload files or directories to cluster:

``` 
cloudtik rsync-up /path/to/your-cluster-config.yaml [source] [target]
```
  
Download files or directories from cluster

```
cloudtik rsync-down /path/to/your-cluster-config.yaml [source] [target]
```

#### Start or Stop Runtime Services

```
cloudtik runtime start /path/to/your-cluster-config.yaml
cloudtik runtime stop /path/to/your-cluster-config.yaml
```

#### Scale Up or Scale Down Cluster

Scale up the cluster with a specific number cpus or nodes.

Try with `--cpus` or `--nodes`.

```
cloudtik scale --cpus xx /path/to/your-cluster-config.yaml
cloudtik scale --nodes x /path/to/your-cluster-config.yaml
```

For more information as to the commands, you can use `cloudtik --help` or `cloudtik [command] --help` to get detailed instructions.
